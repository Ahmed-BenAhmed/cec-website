          p.about-hero__text 
            | Founded in 2022, <strong>Computer Engineering Club (CEC)</strong> started as a small group of passionate students 
            | with a shared vision: creating a vibrant tech community within ENSA Berrechid. What began 
            | with just a handful of members has rapidly grown into one of the most active and 
            | influential student tech organizations on campus.
          p.about-hero__text
            | Today, we provide a platform for students to develop technical skills, 
            | collaborate on innovative projects, and connect with industry professionals.
